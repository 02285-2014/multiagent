\section{Introduction}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas \& \\ Morten}
Short introduction about the course, where we are taking it.

\subsection{Scenario}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas \& \\ Morten}
Short short short scenario description.

\subsection{Problems}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas \& \\ Morten}
The problems to overcome, maybe we should list a problem for each agent a long with some common problems.

\section{Environment}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas}
Short introduction of the environment (map to be explored, knowledge to be shared, agents needing to communictate)...

\subsection{Map}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas}
Explain that the environment is represented as an edge weighted graph, nodes has to be probed, edges has to be surveyed etc.

\subsection{Knowledge}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas}
Explain that all knowledge is shared among the agents.

\subsection{Communication}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas}
Explain that the agents use their shared knowledge to perceive the world, but they communicate when in need of help

\section{Strategy}
\marginpar{\tt Morten}
Something short about what our initial strategies have been for the game. We split up the game in two modes, exploring and zone controlling.

\subsection{Mapping}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas}
Something about who does what while mapping.

\subsection{Zone Control Mode}
\marginpar{\tt Morten}
Something about what zone control mode is, why we do it etc.

\section{Agents}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas}
Some general stuff about the agents here. Mentioning there are five different types etc.

\subsection{Agent Base}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas}
Something about the {\tt CustomAgent} that all the agents derive from, explaining that some of the logic is used within all the agents.

\subsection{Explorer Agent}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas}
The job of the explorer agent, how we solve it and what it does during zone control mode etc.

\subsection{Inspector Agent}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas}
The job of the inspector agent, how we solve it and what it does during zone control mode etc.

\subsection{Repairer Agent}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas \& \\Peter}
The job of the repairer agent, how we solve it and what it does during zone control mode etc.

\subsection{Saboteur Agent}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas \& \\Peter}
The job of the saboteur agent, how we solve it and what it does during zone control mode etc.

\subsection{Sentinel Agent}
\marginpar{\tt Morten}
The job of the sentinel agent, how we solve it and what it does during zone control mode etc.

\section{Planning}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas}
Introduction to planning.

\subsection{Planning Center}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas}
Explain that some actions are only to be performed by one agent, that they "bid" on actions etc.

\subsection{Distress Center}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas}
Explain that agents can call for help, that repairers respond and that the distress center works with the planning center.

\section{Zone Control}
\marginpar{\tt Morten}
What is zone controlling, what is a good zone.

\subsection{Algorithms}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas \& \\ Morten}
Thoughts about how to get a good zone.

\subsubsection{Isolated Subgraph}
\marginpar{\tt Morten}
Pick a big node, expand around it.

\subsubsection{Max Sum Component}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas}
Find connected components, take the one with maximum sum of specific size.

\subsubsection{Simmulated Annealing}
\marginpar{\tt Morten}
Something super smart and awesome here!

\subsubsection{Comparison}
\marginpar{\tt Morten}
Input real test numbers here!

\subsection{Guarding The Zone}
\marginpar{\tt Morten}
What does it mean to guard a zone, how do we plan to do it.

\section{Conclusion}
\marginpar{\tt Andreas \& \\ Morten \& \\ Peter}
Conclude on the problems, state that we solved most of them if not all.

\subsection{Flaws}
\marginpar{\tt Peter}
A shit load of flaws in our solution and hopefully how to remedy them had we had more time!
